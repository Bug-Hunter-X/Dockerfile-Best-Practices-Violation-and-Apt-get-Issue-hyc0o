This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution.  The original `Dockerfile` uses the very large and frequently updated `ubuntu:latest` base image and omits the `-y` flag in its `apt-get` command.  This can lead to unpredictable build behavior and longer build times. The `Dockerfile_fixed` version offers a better approach, using a more specific version of Ubuntu and automatically accepting package installations.
